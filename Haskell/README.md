# Haskell AoC

This is a collection of solutions to the Advent of Code in Haskell.

The project is set up in such a way that the answers are calculated and output when main is run.

I did not include my input data, so in order to run this on your own, you need to create a 
directory under the AoC directory titled /input/ which contains a subdirectory for each 
year, each of which contains the input in the form of a text file of the form
input\<n\>.txt for each day n. Otherwise, you'll need to change the way the Run.hs files 
read the input.
