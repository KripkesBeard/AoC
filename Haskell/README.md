# Haskell AoC

This is a collection of solutions to the Advent of Code in Haskell.

The project is set up in such a way that the answers are calculated and output when main is run.

I did not include my input data, so in order to run them on your own, you need to create a directory in the
folder that has the structure input/\<year\>/ and then the input is called input\<n\>.txt for each puzzle for each year. 
In order to change the input structure to something else, you need to change how the run function in each Run module.
